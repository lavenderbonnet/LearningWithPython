# You go on a wonderful holiday (perhaps to jail, 
# if you donâ€™t like happy exercises) leaving on day 
# number 3 (a Wednesday). You return home after 137 
# sleeps. Write a general version of the program 
# which asks for the starting day number, and the 
# length of your stay, and it will tell you the name 
# of day of the week you will return on.
